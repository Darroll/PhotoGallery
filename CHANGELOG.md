# Changelog

Newest first. "Needs attention" marks anything an existing user must do when updating.

## Unreleased

- Published to Unraid Community Apps. The public image is `ghcr.io/darroll/photogallery`. Pushes to `main` publish only `:edge`; `:latest` and the version tags (`:1.0.0`, `:1.0`) move only on a tagged release, and only after the tests pass.
- New documentation: [Getting started](docs/GETTING-STARTED.md) and [Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
- Template changes: it now pulls from GitHub's container registry, uses the default bridge network, and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is optional. **Needs attention:** if you installed from the author's earlier private template, edit the container and set Repository to `ghcr.io/darroll/photogallery:latest` to follow public updates.
- Earlier work (galleries, downloads, RAW, ZIP, watermarks, share links, guest uploads, likes, comments, SSO, email alerts, backups) is described in the [README](README.md).
